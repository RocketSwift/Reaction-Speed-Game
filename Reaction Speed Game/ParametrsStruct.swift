After you press the Play button, the game will begin in 3 seconds.

The goal of the game is to tap 10 times as quickly as possible on the round dot that will appear on your screen. Take into account that the target's position and color will change with each tap.

Your result will be 'quick' if you finish the game in less than 7 seconds.

If you finish the game in 7 to 16 seconds, your result will be 'normal'.

Your results will be 'slow' if you take more than 16 seconds.

You can restart the game once it has finished.
